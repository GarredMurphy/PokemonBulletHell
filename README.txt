Use the mouse to control the player character.

press q, w, e, and r to fire.


Currently this code only uses Type object design pattern.  I started writing a fixed state machine but i didn't finish it.


VERSION LOG:

December 2, 2017:

I did not have time to do very much work on this during the last week do do spending a lot of time working on projects in other classes.

I have made improvements for the code that creates the bullet paterns and i also edited the bullets to be able to trigger when they touch each other.

I also made some changes to the file structure.

Currently the only bullets that react to each other are fire bullets and water bullets.

There also currently is a glitch that is stopping enemies from firing.


In the next version I am going to include a observer / event design patter.
